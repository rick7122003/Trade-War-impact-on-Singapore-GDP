Trade War impact on Singapore GDP. Early Phase of Trump Tariffs 10% on Singapore exports makes 2025 GDP revision from 1-3% to 0-2%

Executive Summary

Singapore’s economy is at a critical juncture, balancing domestic resilience with global vulnerabilities. The revised 2025 GDP forecast reflects a cautious outlook amid trade wars and economic uncertainty. While Q1 2025 growth of 3.8% YoY is commendable, the QoQ contraction and sectoral declines signal challenges ahead. MTI’s proactive monitoring and potential for further adjustments will be crucial as Singapore navigates this turbulent global landscape. The next Economic Survey in May 2025 will provide deeper insights into these trends.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) of Singapore released a report on April 14, 2025, detailing the economic performance for the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2025) and revising the GDP growth forecast for the year. Based on advance estimates, Singapore’s GDP grew by 3.8% year-on-year (YoY) in Q1 2025, a slowdown from the 5.0% growth in Q4 2024. On a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) seasonally adjusted basis, the economy contracted by 0.8%, reversing the 0.5% expansion in the previous quarter. This contraction reflects declines in manufacturing and outward-oriented services sectors like finance & insurance, driven by weakening external demand. Consequently, MTI downgraded the 2025 GDP growth forecast from 1.0%-3.0% to 0.0%-2.0%, citing global trade tensions and economic uncertainties.

Economic Performance in Q1 2025
The YoY GDP growth of 3.8% in Q1 2025 marks a decline from the 2024 annual average of 4.4%, with quarterly figures showing a peak of 5.7% in Q3 2024 before moderating. The QoQ contraction of 0.8% indicates a sequential slowdown, contrasting with the growth seen throughout 2024 (e.g., 3.0% in Q3 2024). This suggests a loss of momentum, particularly in sectors sensitive to global demand.

Sectoral Breakdown (YoY)
Goods Producing Industries: Grew by 4.7% YoY, slightly up from 4.2% in 2024. Manufacturing expanded by 5.0%, down from 7.4% in Q4 2024, with growth in most clusters except chemicals and general manufacturing. Construction grew steadily at 4.6%, supported by both public and private sector output.
Services Producing Industries: Growth slowed to 3.4% YoY from 4.4% in 2024. The wholesale & retail trade and transportation & storage sectors grew by 4.2%, down from 5.6%, driven by machinery and water transport segments but weakened by retail trade. The information & communications, finance & insurance, and professional services group grew by 3.0%, a decline from 4.4%, despite demand for IT solutions and banking. The accommodation & food services, real estate, and administrative services group maintained 2.5% growth, buoyed by a surge in private residential property transactions.
Sectoral Breakdown (QoQ, Seasonally Adjusted)
Goods Producing Industries: Contracted by 4.0%, with manufacturing shrinking by 4.9% (worsening from flat growth in Q4 2024) and construction declining by 2.3% (from 0.3% growth).
Services Producing Industries: Grew marginally by 0.3%. The wholesale & retail trade and transportation & storage sectors expanded by 0.5%, recovering from a 0.1% contraction. However, the information & communications, finance & insurance, and professional services group shrank by 5.0%, a sharp reversal from 5.9% growth, reflecting external demand pressures. The accommodation & food services, real estate, and administrative services group grew by 1.4%, up from 0.3%.
Revised Economic Outlook for 2025
MTI downgraded the 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.0%-2.0% from 1.0%-3.0%, reflecting a weaker global economic outlook. This revision is driven by escalating US-China trade tensions, including a US baseline tariff of 10% on all countries and higher reciprocal tariffs on nations with trade surpluses, particularly China. Despite a 90-day pause on some tariffs, the intensifying trade war—coupled with existing product-specific tariffs—threatens global trade and growth. The World Trade Organization (WTO) revised its 2025 merchandise trade growth projection to -1.0% from 3.0%, estimating an 80% reduction in US-China trade.

Global Economic Impacts
US and China: Rising US import costs are expected to weaken consumption, while China’s export growth stalls due to tariffs, softening both economies’ growth outlooks.
Regional Economies: Reduced external demand and dampened business/consumer sentiment are likely to curb domestic consumption and investment in Southeast Asia.
Global Risks: The report highlights three risks: (1) uncertainty-driven pullbacks in economic activity, (2) a potential full-blown global trade war disrupting supply chains, and (3) disruptions to global disinflation and recession risks triggering financial instability.
Impact on Singapore
Singapore’s outward-oriented sectors face significant challenges:

Manufacturing: Likely to weaken due to reduced global demand.
Wholesale Trade and Transportation & Storage: Expected to slow as global trade contracts, affecting shipping and air cargo demand.
Finance & Insurance: Risk-off sentiments may reduce trading activity, impacting banking and fund management fees, while economic uncertainty could constrain credit intermediation and payments firms’ growth.
Despite these challenges, domestic-oriented sectors like real estate show resilience, supported by property transactions. However, the overall outlook remains cautious, with MTI emphasizing the need to monitor global developments closely.

Analysis and Implications
The 3.8% YoY growth in Q1 2025, while positive, indicates a cooling economy compared to 2024’s 4.4% annual growth, driven by external headwinds. The QoQ contraction of 0.8% underscores the vulnerability of Singapore’s export-driven economy to global demand shocks. Manufacturing, a key growth driver in 2024 (11.2% YoY in Q3), is now slowing, with a 4.9% QoQ decline signaling potential challenges ahead. Services sectors, particularly finance & insurance, are also under pressure, with a 5.0% QoQ contraction reflecting global risk aversion.

The downgraded 2025 forecast of 0.0%-2.0% highlights significant downside risks. The US-China trade war, as a primary driver, could disrupt Singapore’s trade-dependent economy, given its role as a global trading hub. The WTO’s projected -1.0% global merchandise trade growth for 2025 amplifies these concerns. Sectors like wholesale trade and transportation & storage, which rely on global trade flows, are particularly at risk, while finance & insurance may face reduced activity amid market volatility.

However, some sectors show resilience. Construction’s steady 4.6% YoY growth and real estate’s robust performance suggest domestic demand remains a buffer. The information & communications sector also benefits from digitalization trends, though its QoQ decline indicates sensitivity to global conditions.
